# baby-tools

We recently had a baby and we wanted a way to track his nap/sleep times. There are many sites out there, that can do this, but we didn't want to get bombarded with marketing emails once we sign up. 

This is a humble attempt to build our own software. 

# Tech Stack 

I wanted to learn go programming language, so I chose to use golang as the server technology.
I used React JS as front end technology as I already know how to build and run react apps.
I used MYSQL DB just because I had already used it in my home data center.

# Deployment 

I deployed currently in my home data center behind firewall. I will expose it to internet soon.
